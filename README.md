# Kotlin Map Function: Common Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using the `map` function in Kotlin and provides solutions to avoid those errors.

The `map` function is a powerful tool for transforming collections in Kotlin, but it's important to understand how to handle potential issues like null values and type mismatches.

## Common Errors:

* **Type Mismatches:** Attempting to map a collection to a different incompatible type can lead to compilation errors or unexpected behavior. 
* **Null Safety:**  Incorrect handling of null values can result in `NullPointerExceptions` when using map.

## Solutions:

The solution file provides examples of handling these errors correctly, including the safe call operator (`?.`) and the Elvis operator (`?:`) to address null values in collections effectively.
